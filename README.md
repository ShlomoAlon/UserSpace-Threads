This is a User Space Threads library in C that I implemented for my operating system course. It is one of the coolest assignments I have ever done. It implements threading on top of
the get/set context primitives as well as signals.

This was very fun to write except for a couple of incredibly head scratching bugs. 

Note: if the assignment is ever going to be reused please contact me and I'll delete this immiedietly.
